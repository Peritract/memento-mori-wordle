# Memento Mori

This is Wordle, but the answer is always "death".

## Creation

I did not actually write this myself from scratch; the code in this repository is just an edited version of [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish)'s original code. In the unlikely event of any credit, it all goes to him.

All I've done is change the game so that there's only one correct answer ("death", as above), and then edit the fluff text to be a bit more focused on inescapable mortality.

For obvious reasons, this is not intended as a competitor to Wordle in any way, but more as an homage and a commentary.

## Why

It's a little hard to explain but I was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/pursuedbytruth/status/1496205943306137604) (along with a selfish interest in understanding how Wordle was put together). The tweet itself is part of, and reference to, a long-running Christian tradition that [is better explained by others](https://pursuedbytruth.com/).
